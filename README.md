# 🟥 RED THREAD / F.R.I. — Fracture Readiness Index

> **Coherence under fracture** — a systems-grade approach to resilience, constraint, and recovery for humans, machines, and the spaces they share.

---

![RED THREAD Banner](docs/images/redthread-banner.png)  
<sub>*Concept visual — symbolic of signal persistence through entropic conditions.*</sub>

---

## 📜 Ethos

The **RED THREAD** is more than a platform — it’s a principle.  
A symbolic and operational weave that:

- Preserves *signal through noise*
- Connects *actors across isolation*
- Anchors *decisions in constraint-aware reality*

Grounded in the **Fracture Readiness Index (FRI)**, it blends *operational doctrine* with *humanistic insight* to build systems that *adapt without collapse*.

> *"In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order."* — Carl Jung

---

## 🌌 Purpose

The RED THREAD system trains and measures:

1. **Detection** — Early recognition of weak or ambiguous signals  
2. **Communication** — Clarity under degraded or high-volume conditions  
3. **Decision** — Sound choices under paradox, ambiguity, or incomplete data  
4. **Logistics** — Adaptive movement of resources and actors under pressure  
5. **Recovery** — Regaining stability with minimal readiness debt  

---

## 🧭 Vision

A **global-ready**, **civic-conscious** platform where:

- Humans and AI agents coordinate in multi-vector stress environments
- Resilience is measured, not guessed
- Ethical scope is **enforced in runtime**, not as an afterthought
- Collapse conditions become *training ground*, not *end state*
